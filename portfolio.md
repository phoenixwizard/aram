=====================
Language independent Lexicon Building Tool
http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/IndoWordnetPapers/09_iwn_Language%20independent %20Lexicon%20building%20tool.doc
December 2010
In this paper, we propose a system for aligning the bilingual corpora to create the dictionary for English to Indian languages
and vice versa which can be used in different Natural Language Processing applications. Different tools like POS Tagger, chunker
and clause breaker are used for an effective and efficient alignment of corpora. These tools help to handle complex sentences,
name entity and phrases in the sentences. This method gives a better accuracy than using the complete sentence as a whole. The
tool is tested for six pairs among English, Hindi and Urdu languages.
