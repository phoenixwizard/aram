My name is Aram Bhusal a.k.a. Phoenixwizard. I love creating stuff. Whether it be products, code or music !!

I have a Fender guitar which gathers dust from time to time and a Cycle which sees the day of light once a day !! And of course I have a DSLR without having the cheesy Photography page on facebook !!

I love food !! Specially Iranian food. I finish the food before you instagram it !!
